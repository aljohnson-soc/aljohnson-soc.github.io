## Research on teaching and learning

One line of my research builds from my pedagogy, which centers equitable, evidence-based teaching practices. In work published in *Teaching Sociology*, Rebecca Gleit and I outline strategies to improve the integration of statistical software into introductory statistics courses to better prepare sociology students to be responsible citizens in a data-centered society. The Stata workshop linked above is the foundation of this paper.
