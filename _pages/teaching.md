## Research on teaching and learning

One line of my research trajectory builds from my pedagogy, which centers equitable, evidence-based teaching practices. In work published in *Teaching Sociology*, graduate student co-author Rebecca Gleit and I outline strategies to improve the integration of statistical software into introductory statistics courses to better prepare sociology students to be responsible citizens in a data-centered society. The Stata workshop linked above is the foundation of this paper.

## Teaching and software consulting

As a graduate student consultant with Stanford's [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.stanford.edu/ta-training-support/graduate-teaching-consultants), I offer services such as video observations and student feedback sessions to help graduate student instructors and teaching assistants improve their teaching. I also collaboratively design and teach workshops on topics such as anti-racist and equitable teaching, backwards design, active learning, and effective grading.

As a consultant with Stanford Library's [Software and Services for Data Science](https://ssds.stanford.edu/) group, I help members of the Stanford community use statistical software in their classes and/or research. I provide software support for R, Stata, Dedoose, and NVivo, as well as advice on selecting a software program, finding data, and organizing workflow and data storage.
