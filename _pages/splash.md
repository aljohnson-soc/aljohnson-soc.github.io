<img align="right" src="assets/images/headshot.JPG" width = 350 hspace="20">  My research employs mixed methodologies to explore sensemaking around axes of social difference, and how this process is informed by social and cultural change over time. In my dissertation, *From Deviance to Diagnosis: Cultural Meanings of Mental Health*, I use computational text analysis to analyze discourse and language around mental health in the news media and on social media. I focus on how mental health and illness are both normalized and “otherized” in the cultural imagination. <br /><br /> I’m also passionate about equitable and inclusive teaching, particularly of quantitative methods and statistical software. <br/><br/> I have a BA from Wellesley College, where I majored in Sociology and Spanish. In addition to my work in the Sociology Department, I work as a [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.stanford.edu/) graduate student consultant, as a graduate research assistant at the Stanford [VMWare Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab](https://womensleadership.stanford.edu/), and as a software consultant for Stanford Library’s [Software and Services for Data Science (SSDS)](https://ssds.stanford.edu/). <br /><br /> Contact me at aljohnson [at] stanford [dot] edu
