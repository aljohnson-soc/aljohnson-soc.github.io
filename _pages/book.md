My first book project, *Our Mental Health, Their Mental Illness* (under contract with Princeton University Press), uses computational text analysis of newspaper and Reddit data to trace how mental health and illness have become widely shared cultural ideas. I argue that, extending far beyond their medical roots, mental health and illness have become understood as two sides of a social, not just medical, boundary  with consequences for social stratification and stigma.

More information to come.
