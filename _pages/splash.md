<img align="right" src="assets/images/headshot_johnson.jpg" width = 350 hspace="20">  I am a cultural, computational, and medical sociologist. In my dissertation and book project, I explore dramatic sociocultural change around mental health and illness. I use computational text analysis to analyze discourse in the news media and on social media, focusing on how mental health and illness are alternately normalized and “otherized” in the cultural imagination. <br /><br /> I’m also passionate about equitable and inclusive teaching, particularly of quantitative methods and statistical software. <br/><br/> I have a BA from Wellesley College, where I majored in Sociology and Spanish. In addition to my work in the Stanford Sociology Department, I work as a [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.stanford.edu/) graduate student consultant, as a graduate research assistant at the Stanford [VMWare Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab](https://womensleadership.stanford.edu/), and as a software consultant for Stanford Library’s [Software and Services for Data Science (SSDS)](https://ssds.stanford.edu/). In fall 2023, I will be joining the Sociology and Anthropology Department at Lehigh University as an Assistant Professor of Sociology. <br /><br /> Contact me at aljohnson [at] stanford [dot] edu
