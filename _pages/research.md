## Research on mental health beliefs and behaviors

The primary component of my research trajectory applies cultural sociology to contextualize long-term trends in mental health and treatment in the United States. I focus on changing understandings and beliefs at the macro level and how they connect to individuals’ behaviors and decision-making. 

In my dissertation, *From Deviance to Diagnosis: Cultural Meanings of Mental Health*, I use qualitatively informed computational text analysis and custom text datasets to map the cultural conversation on mental health. In the first part of the dissertation, I employ a corpus of over 100,000 newspaper articles from 1980 to 2020 and structural topic modeling to analyze framings of mental health and illness in the news media, associations with dangerousness and violence, and the consequences for cultural understandings of mental health and illness. With the same corpus, I also utilize word embeddings to measure how aspects of mental health and illness are normalized or otherized over time. In the second part of the dissertation, I use a contemporary corpus of Reddit posts to assess how people deploy different frames to make sense of their mental health experiences.

In published work in the *Journal of Health and Social Behavior*, I conducted an age-period-cohort analysis of psychological distress and mental health treatment-seeking using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to demonstrate the role of social and cultural change in driving increased treatment-seeking over time.

## Research on gender beliefs

In collaborative research conducted through the [VMWare Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab](https://womensleadership.stanford.edu/), I explore how young adults’ gender beliefs are informed by cultural ideas of individualism and agency and contribute to persistent gender inequality by directing young adults away from structural solutions. The project, which uses longitudinal interview and survey data, is still ongoing and findings have been published in *Social Problems* and *Sociological Perspectives*.
