My research employs mixed methodologies to explore sensemaking around axes of social difference, and how this process is informed by social and cultural change over time. In my dissertation, *From Deviance to Diagnosis: Cultural Meanings of Mental Health*, I use computational text analysis to analyze discourse and language around mental health in the news media and on social media. I focus on how mental health and illness are both normalized and “otherized” in the cultural imagination.

I’m also passionate about equitable and inclusive teaching, particularly of quantitative methods and statistical software.

I have a BA from Wellesley College, where I majored in Sociology and Spanish. In addition to my work in the Sociology Department, I work as a [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://href.li/?https://ctl.stanford.edu/) graduate student consultant, as a graduate research assistant at the Stanford [VMWare Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab](https://href.li/?https://womensleadership.stanford.edu/), and as a software consultant for Stanford Library’s [Software and Services for Data Science (SSDS)](https://href.li/?https://ssds.stanford.edu/).
